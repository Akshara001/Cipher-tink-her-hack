# EMENO

 EMENO is an emergency notification application 
system. This app is made specifically by gaining access to various 
messaging applications such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, 
discord, telegram, etc. Be it a casual message to a close friend, but a 
serious one, the message sent can be called out as an emergency 
text using the EMENO app. Even when the receiver's phone is in 
silent mode, a ringtone or an alarm system will alert the receiver 
about the emergency text message.

Stack / Technologies used:

This app shall mainly be built using JAVA and XML. The UI/UX design is 
intended to be done using Figma to showcase our app. The user will be asked to give 
access to their respective accounts on the various social media 
platforms that they wish to use for texting. Through the APIs of these 
platforms, our application we gain access to the important text 
messages as indicated by the sender. Upon successful operation, the 
receiverâ€™s device will be buzzed to indicate that an important 
message is to be brought to your notice by the use of a ringing of the 
device through the ringtone system or the common alarm. The 
alarming facility may be customised by the user on their respective 
devices.
